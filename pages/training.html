  <p>
    All of our slides, notes, and example programs are in our Git repositories at
    <a href="{{site.github_url}}/bc">{{site.github_url}}/bc</a>,
    and
    <a href="{{site.github_url}}/site">{{site.github_url}}/site</a>
    under <a href="{{page.root}}/license.html">open access licenses</a>:
    you are free to use them however you want
    so long as you <a href="{{page.root}}/license.html">give us attribution</a>.
    Everything is designed so that individuals can work through what they need on their own,
    but universities, research labs, companies, and self-study groups have also used it
    in week-long crash courses and as part of longer classroom courses.

  <p>
    We also run an online training course to help people become instructors.
    The course requires 2-4 hours/week for 8-10 weeks,
    and covers the basics of educational psychology,
    instructional design,
    and how to apply both to teaching programming to scientists.
