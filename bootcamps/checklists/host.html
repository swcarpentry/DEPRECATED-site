title: Bootcamp Checklist &mdash; Host
---

<p>
  A bootcamp host is a person (or group of people)
  who would like to arrange a bootcamp at their university,
  research lab,
  company,
  conference,
  or other venue.
  Hosts are responsible for finding funding for the bootcamp, 
  booking a room and catering,
  recruiting local helpers,
  and finding supplies like extension cords and sticky notes.
</p>

<div class="well">
  <h4>Getting Started</h4>
  <p>
    If you're considering hosting a bootcamp,
    think about:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Where it will be:
      Is a <a href="{{page.root}}/bootcamps/operations.html#host_venue">good
        venue</a> available?
      Will it cost anything to book?
    </li>
    <li>
      When it will be:
      Lots of factors will affect
      <a href="{{page.root}}/bootcamps/operations.html#host_when">when you can
        hold your bootcamp</a>;
      think about what makes sense for you and your audience.
      Be flexible,
      because instructor availability at our end will be a factor too.
    </li>
    <li>
      How you will fund it:
      The <a href="{{page.root}}/bootcamps/operations.html#host_cost">cost of
        running a bootcamp</a>
      includes instructors' travel and lodging,
      the Software Carpentry administration fee, 
      the cost of booking the room,
      and catering.
    </li>
    <li>
      Who the audience will be:
      Will the bootcamp be open to
      people in your lab,
      in your department,
      at your university or company,
      attending a conference,
      or anyone nearby?
      <a href="{{page.root}}/bootcamps/operations.html#host_numbers">How 
        many learners</a> can you accommodate?
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    The answers to those questions will determine:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><a href="{{page.root}}/bootcamps/operations.html#host_who">Who will be
      permitted</a> to attend the bootcamp.</li>
    <li><a href="{{page.root}}/bootcamps/operations.html#host_charge">What 
      it will cost</a> to attend the bootcamp (if anything).</li>
    <li><a href="{{page.root}}/bootcamps/operations.html#host_followup">What
      kind of follow-up</a> will be offered.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    After you've thought about all that,
    <a href="mailto:{{site.contact}}">contact Software Carpentry admin</a>
    and let us know:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      your location and institution;
    </li>
    <li>
      your potential dates;
    </li>
    <li>
      the likely audience (research field, previous computing experience); and
    </li>
    <li>
      how many learners you're expecting.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="well">  
  <h4>Finalize Details</h4>
  <p>
    Together with the Software Carpentry administrator:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Find <a href="{{page.root}}/bootcamps/operations.html#host_instructors">two or three instructors</a> per room.
    </li>
    <li>
      Set a date.
    </li>
    <li>
      Set up registration (if you are handling it yourself)
      or give Software Carpentry admin the
 <a href="{{page.root}}/bootcamps/operations.html#host_registration">information      needed</a>
      to set up an Eventbrite registration page.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="well">
  <h4>Local Coordination</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
    Book a room, keeping in mind 
    the <a href="{{page.root}}/bootcamps/operations.html#host_venue">ideal 
      room characteristics</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Recruit <a href="{{page.root}}/bootcamps/operations.html#host_helpers">helpers</a>.</li>
    <li>
      Discuss the bootcamp content and audience with instructors.
      (Software Carpentry admin will set up a mailing list for you,
      your instructors,
      and the helpers.)
    </li>
    <li>
      If you are restricting registration to a particular audience,
      monitor registration.
      (Software Carpentry admin will give you access to the Eventbrite event.)
    </li>
    <li>
      Book <a href="{{page.root}}/bootcamps/operations.html#host_catering">catering</a>
      (if you are supplying coffee and snacks)
      or find out where the nearest coffee shop is.
    </li>
    <li>
      Obtain or locate <a href="{{page.root}}/bootcamps/operations.html#host_equipment">all necessary gear</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Confirm that instructors have booked their travel
      and that they know how to submit receipts for reimbursement.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you are using something other than 
      first-come&ndash;first-served registration,
      select the attendees you want to attend and 
      let them know they have a seat.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="well">
  <h4>A Week Before</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Email bootcamp registrants and tell them:
      <ul>
        <li>
	  to visit the bootcamp web page for setup information,
          bootcamp location,
	  etc.
	  Emphasize the importance of setting up their computers well in advance.
	</li>
        <li>
	  to let us know if they can't come to the bootcamp.
          (They can't cancel their own registration on Eventbrite&mdash;they 
          have to email you or Software Carpentry admin.)
	</li>
        <li>
	  anything else they need to know about the location, parking, etc.
	</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      If there are cancellations,
      offer those spaces to people on the waiting list.
      (Eventbrite doesn't do this automatically.)
      <!--FIXME need a link to section in OG about EB waiting lists.-->
    </li>

      If possible,
      plan dinner or drinks with the helpers and instructors 
      the evening before the bootcamp.
    </li>
    <li>
      Find out where the bathrooms are,
      how to work the air conditioning,
      and who to call if something goes wrong with the facility or network.
    </li>
    <li>
      Make sure security will be expecting you and the doors will be unlocked.
    </li>

      Remind helpers to mingle and encourage conversation
      as well as answer questions and debug setup problems.

      As learners arrive,

      Stay on top of the catering:
      replenish snacks,

    <h4>Pitfalls for Hosts</h4>

    <p>
    Organizing a good bootcamp is not trivial, 
    and there are a few pitfalls to avoid.
    </p>

    <dt>Don't underestimate setup requirements</dt>  
    <dd>
      <p>
	Do you have enough power outlets?  (Are you sure?)
	Do you have enough bandwidth to handle fifty people hitting your version control repository at the same time?  (How do you know?)
	Can everyone actually log in?
	Does campus security know you're using the room over the weekend?
      </p>
    </dd>

    <dl>
    <dt>Don't let your learners ignore each other.</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
      Software Carpentry bootcamps are a great networking opportunity
      for our learners (and for us, too).
      Get to know your learners by name,
      have them work in pairs, and get them to mix up the pairs
      at least a couple of times.
        Encourage them to chat to one another at coffee breaks and lunch,
        and to get a pizza or some curry together for dinner on the first day.
      </p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Don't Underestimate The Potential for Mishaps</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
      Something always fails to install for someone (or they fail to install
      anything at all), or a bunch of learners are accidentally locked out of
      the building after lunch, or whoever was supposed to drop off power bars
      didn't.  Roll with it, and remember to laugh (even if it's a bit
      hysterically).
