  <h3>Preliminaries</h3>
  <p>
    Before the bootcamp host has committed to holding a bootcamp, 
    Software Carpentry admin helps them decide 
    when and where the bootcamp should be,
    advises on likely cost,
    and provides other guidance.

  <h3>Initial Setup</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Find <a href="{{page.root}}/bootcamps/operations.html#host_instructors">instructors</a>.
      This should be done <em>before</em> the bootcamp is publicly announced.
    </li>
    <li>
      Either create a 
      <a href="{{page.root}}/bootcamps/operations.html#admin_webpage">Github web page</a> for the bootcamp
      or ask the lead instructor to do it.
    </li>
    <li>
    Set up an 
    <a href="{{page.root}}/bootcamps/operations.html#eventbrite">Eventbrite 
      event</a>
