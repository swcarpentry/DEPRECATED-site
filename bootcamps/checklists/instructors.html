title: Bootcamp Checklist &mdash; Instructors
---

<p>
  Instructors lecture and lead practical exercises.
  You should also help learners during practical sessions,
  but remember to rest your voice as well.
  You <em>don't</em> need to know the curriculum
  for all the topics in your bootcamp,
  but it certainly helps
  (particularly if someone can't make it at the last minute).
</p>
  
<div class="well">
  <h4>Before</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Arrange travel to the bootcamp site,
      accommodation,
      and transportation from your lodging
      to the bootcamp site.
    </li>
    <li>
      Find out (from the host) how to be reimbursed for travel expenses.
    </li>
    <li>
    Work with the 
    <a href="{{page.root}}/bootcamps/checklists/lead_instructor.html">lead instructor</a> to figure out 
      who's teaching what and when.
    </li>
    <li>
      Choose or prepare your lessons,
      data sets,
      cheat sheets, 
      exercises,
      and version control repositories.
    </li>
    <li>
      Post your exercises, data sets, and cheat sheets
      on the bootcamp's web site.
      (The lead instructor
      will create a GitHub repository
      to host the bootcamp's web pages.)
    </li>
    <li>
      Work through your own setup instructions to make sure they're complete,
      and to ensure that you have the same setup as your learners.
    </li>
    <li>
      Do a dry-run of your entire lesson; 
      this allows you to try out your examples and exercises 
      to make sure they (still) work, 
      and to make sure you'll have enough time to 
      present all your material 
      (or enough material to fill your time).
    </li>
    <li>
      Familiarize yourself with the material your fellow instructors will be presenting,
      in case one of them pulls out or loses their voice.
    </li>
    <li>
      Review 
      <a href="{{page.root}}/bootcamps/operations.html#instructors_practices">good instruction practices</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Familiarize yourself with
      <a href="#instructors_pitfalls">common pitfalls</a>.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>
  
<div class="well">
  <h4>After the Boot Camp</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Complete the instructors' post-bootcamp questionnaire.
    </li>
    <li>
      Send any other feedback you have
      to Software Carpentry admin.
    </li>
    <li>
      Upload improvements to common lesson material to GitHub
      and send a pull request to the master repository.
    </li>
  </ul>

    <h4>Pitfalls for Instructors</h4>

    <p>
      Instructing at a bootcamp isn't trivial.
      The most important thing is to remember that
      no lesson plan survives contact with the audience.
      Whether it's the network going down
      or the sudden realization that many of your learners
      <em>don't</em> know how to use SSH,
      you will frequently need to improvise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even without hiccups like those,
      try your best to adjust your pace and examples based on
      learners' questions, puzzled looks, and sighs of impatience.
    </p>
    
    <dl>

      <dt>Allow enough time for setup</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          In almost all cases,
          learners want to use their own laptops during bootcamps
          so that they leave with a working environment set up.
          Even if you ask attendees to prepare beforehand,
          and give them detailed instructions,
          some will not have time, 
          or will have run into problems that they're not yet able to fix.
          You should therefore schedule at least 20 minutes for
          <em>checking the learners' machines</em>
          at the beginning of the first day.
          Some bootcamps start early on the first day to allow time to
          troubleshoot setup problems.
        </p>
        </dd>
    <dt>Don't ignore your learners</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
        You're not there to reproduce one of our online videos in person:
        you're there to interact with people so that they get a
        better learning experience.
        You shouldn't ever go more than two or three minutes without
        asking a question (and listening to the answer),
        and if it has been 15 minutes since any of your learners asked one,
        odds are you've either lost them or are boring them.
    </dd>

    <dt>Don't bore your learners</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
        Your audience will never care more about what you're teaching 
        than you appear to,
        so if they get the feeling you're not interested in it,
	they won't be either.
	This does <em>not</em> mean you have to shout,
	crack three jokes a minute,
	or harangue them about how this stuff is really, really important,
	but you do owe it to your audience to show up mentally as well as physically.
      </p>
    </dd>
  
    <dt>Don't be all talk, no action.</dt>  
    <dd>
      <p>
        The more time folks spend with their hands on the keyboards 
        doing exercises,
	the more time they're actually paying attention.
	The students have their computers in front of them:
        if you talk for more than five minutes without asking them to 
        use their computers, they'll do so anyway&mdash;on Facebook.
      </p>
    </dd>
  
    <dt>Don't use magic</dt>  
    <dd>
      <p>
        Typing too fast, using shortcuts or commands 
        learners haven't seen yet&mdash;basically,
	any time you say, "Don't worry about this just now,"
        or they say, "Wait, how did you do that?" or, 
        "Can you please slow down, I can't keep up,"
	you're no longer actually helping them.
      </p>
    </dd>
  
    <dt>Don't ignore feedback</h4>
    <dd>
      <p>
        The feedback you get from learners on sticky notes or through
        surveys is pointless if you don't pay attention to it 
        (or worse, if you explain it away).
        There's no point collecting feedback 
        during and after each bootcamp 
        if you don't change what and how you teach to reflect it.
      </p>
    </dd>
    <dt>Tell learners "why".</dt>  
    <dd>
      <p>
	Most of our learners are graduate students in science and engineering,
        so they know what evidence looks like, 
        and why working practices should be evidence-based.
        That doesn't mean you have to have the whole of 
        empirical software engineering at your fingertips,
	but please do read
	<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Facts-Fallacies-Software-Engineering-Robert/dp/0321117425/"><cite>Facts and Fallacies of Software Engineering</cite></a>
	and sprinkle a few of the findings it quotes into your lessons.
      </p>
    </dd>
  
    <dt>Don't show them the forest but not the trees.</dt>  
    <dd>
      <p>
	The things we teach reinforce each other,
	so tie them together at every opportunity.
	Point out that connecting things with pipes in the shell is like chaining functions together,
	or that they can use a shell script to re-run a bunch of different tests before committing to version control,
	and so on.
	If possible, take 15 minutes or so each day to show them how you use these tools in your day-to-day work.
