<p>
  The Software Carpentry Bootcamp Operations Guide includes 
  checklists for each role involved in running a bootcamp, 
  and a long-form description of the story of a bootcamp. 
  The description explains how bootcamps work, 
  and the checklists explain how each role 
  contributes to a successful bootcamp. 
  The checklists will also be useful
  to people who have taken on each role.

<h2>The Story of a Bootcamp</h2>

<p>
  A Software Carpentry bootcamp is an intensive hands-on workshop
  at which scientists learn software skills
  through short tutorials and practical exercises.
  A typical bootcamp runs over two days with 20-50 attendees and
  two or three instructors per room,
  and one helper for every 10 attendees.
  The members of a bootcamp team are:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    The <a href="{{page.root}}/bootcamps/checklists/host.html">host</a>,
    the principal local contact for the bootcamp.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <a href="{{page.root}}/bootcamps/checklists/instructors.html">instructors</a>, who
    present the tutorials and lead the practical exercises.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <a href="{{page.root}}/bootcamps/checklists/lead_instructor.html">lead instructor</a>,
    is in charge of deciding what will be taught by whom 
    and ensuring the teaching aspects of the bootcamp go smoothly.
    Software Carpentry admin decides which instructor will be 
    the lead instructor.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="{{page.root}}/bootcamps/checklists/helpers.html">Helpers</a> 
    provide assistance during practical sessions, 
    update and answer questions on the bootcamp Etherpad, 
    and help with various practical matters.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="{{page.root}}/bootcamps/checklists/admin.html">Software Carpentry admin</a>
    advises and helps the host with bootcamp organization,
    matches hosts with instructors,
    sets up registration and assessments,
    etc.
  </li>
  <li>
    Learners come to the bootcamp to learn.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Note that:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    One person may have several roles in a bootcamp;
    for example,
    it's common for the host to also be a learner.
  </li>
  <li>
    We require hosts, instructors, and learners to adhere to our
    <a href="{{page.root}}/conduct.html">code of conduct</a>.
  </li>
</ul>

<div class="well" id="bootcamp_definition">
  <h4>What makes a bootcamp a <em>Software Carpentry</em> bootcamp?</h4>
  <p>
    As <a href="{{page.root}}/faq.html#who-can-run-a-bootcamp">explained in our FAQ</a>,
    anyone can use our materials and run a bootcamp.
    However,
    you must have our explicit prior permission
    to use our name and logo
    (which are <a href="{{page.root}}/faq.html#trademark">trademarked</a>).
    We normally require that the lead instructor be certified by Software Carpentry,
    and that the training covers:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      using the shell to automate tasks;
    </li>
    <li>
      modular programming;
    </li>
    <li>
      unit testing; and
    </li>
    <li>
      version control.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

  <h3>Early Planning</h3>

  <p>
  Before the bootcamp organization begins, 
  the host has to consider the answers
  to a series of questions.
  At some point in this decision-making process, 
  the host will contact
  Software Carpentry admin to initiate 
  bootcamp planning.
  </p>

    <h4>Who is the bootcamp for?</h4>

    <p>
      The host must think about the intended audience for the bootcamp.
      Will it be restricted to a specific lab, university, or company?
      Will it target people in a particular discipline
      (or range of related disciplines),
      or will it be open to all?
    </p>

    <div id="host_who">
      <h4>Open or closed? Public or private?</h4>
  
      <p>
      A closed bootcamp can be more easily restricted to a specific audience,
      which allows the instructors
      to tailor material to that field.
        In addition,
        attendees are more likely to know one another,
        which in our experience means they're less inhibited about asking
        questions
        and are more likely to help each other during practical sessions.
        </p>
        <p>
        On the other hand,
        it may be harder to find enough people to fill a bootcamp if you
        restrict enrollment,
        and if your funding comes from the university or company level,
        it may be politically difficult to turn people away.
      </p>
      <p>
      Having said that, there are a number of reasons why you 
      might consider allowing
      external personnel to come to your bootcamp:
      </p>
      <ul>
	<li>
          Others can see how a bootcamp is run and decide 
          whether they want to run one too,
          which contributes to the growth and sustainability 
          of Software Carpentry.
	</li>
	<li>
          Attendees are given the opportunity to network and build relationships
	  with researchers from elsewhere within your institution or community,
	  or foster cross-disciplinary collaboration.
	</li>
	<li>
          Your profile is raised within your institution 
          or community as one experienced in hosting bootcamps
	  which means others may seek your advice when they come to run theirs.
	</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

  <div id="host_numbers">
      <h4>How many learners?</h4>

      <p>
      Bootcamps work best with rooms of between 15 and 40 learners. Above
      that, they become more like a lecture and the hands-on workshop feeling
      is lost. If you are expecting significantly more than 40 registrants,
      consider hosting a multi-room bootcamp.
      </p>
      <p>
      Multi-room bootcamps can work very well because they allow us to 
      stream learners into groups according to their computing experience.
      The disadvantage, of course, is that you have to book multiple rooms
      and recruit more instructors and helpers.
      </p>
  </div>



    <h4>What about cost?</h4>
  <p>
  The host needs to think about the cost of running a bootcamp and
  where the money might come from, and apply for funding if necessary.
  </p>

  <div class="well" id="host_cost">
    <h4>The cost of running a bootcamp</h4>
  
    <p>
      Our instructors are volunteers,
      and do not need to be paid for their time,
      but bootcamp hosts are expected to cover their 
      travel and accommodation costs.
      (As much as possible,
      we try to match instructors to nearby sites in order to reduce costs.)
      </p>
      <p>
      We suggest hosting institutions contribute {{site.admin_overhead}} 
      to Software Carpentry, to support 
      central development activities (including 
      curriculum development, 
      instructor training, 
      website maintenance, 
      and administrative costs).
      The hosting site may also have to pay to book the room
      and for catering.
      </p>
      <p>
      Altogether, the total cost for a bootcamp is in the $2500-4000 range,
      depending on instructors' travel costs.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="well" id="host_funding">

    <h4>Possible funding sources</h4>

    <p>
      Some possible sources of funding are:
    </p>
  
    <ul>
      <li>
        "Miscellaneous" funds
        (e.g., a few thousand dollars in a faculty member's grant).
        This is by far the most common case.
      </li>
      <li>
        Training budgets at the lab, department, or institutional level.
      </li>
      <li>
        Workshop budgets set aside as part of conferences.
      </li>
      <li>
          Charging a fee to participants, either when they register 
          or at the door.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="well" id="host_reducing_costs">
    <h4>How to reduce costs</h4>
    <p>
      The host can consider these
      ways to reduce the costs of running a bootcamp:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Find out if there are others in your
        institution or community who are willing to help with instructor
        travel expenses, room bookings and other costs. They may be willing
        to share costs if their researchers can attend your bootcamp&hellip;
      </li>
      <li>
        &hellip;or just go all-out and agree to run one jointly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use local instructors and helpers (by local we mean from within your
        institution, region or country) who will have lower travel costs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Co-locate with conferences or workshops being run by your 
        institution or within your community.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div id="host_charge">

    <h4>Should the bootcamp be free to learners?</h4>
  
      <p>
        The host and admin also need to decide 
        whether the bootcamp is free or not.
      </p>
      <p>
        A $40 fee is an effective way of defraying bootcamp costs,
        and reduces the 
        the number of no-shows from 20-25% to 5% or less. Other options include:
      </p>
      <ul>
          <li>charging a smaller fee and writing us a check to cover the
          difference;</li>
          <li>charging a refundable deposit (refunded to everyone who attends
              both days), which reduces the no-show rate while still
              effectively providing a bootcamp which is free to learners;</li>
            <li>not charging at all</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      Two notes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>If the host decides to charge a fee and keep the revenue 
        to defray the cost of catering and other expenses, 
        we ask them to handle registration.</li>
        <li>Be aware that 
        as soon as you charge anything at all&mdash;even 
        a refundable deposit&mdash;some
        venues will charge for use of the space.</li>
      </ul>
    </div> <!-- host_charge -->

  <div id="host_when">
    <h4>When should the bootcamp be?</h4>
  
    <p>
      Many factors determine when to hold a bootcamp.
      The first is obviously the availability of instructors:
      admin will help with this.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the bootcamp will be at a university,
      the start of term works better than the end of term
      (when people are tired, and busy with final assignments and exams),
      and the start of the second (or subsequent) term 
      works better for graduate students
      than the start of first term.
      (The start of an academic year is busy anyway,
      and by their second term most students have 
      a better idea of their research problem's programming needs.)
      In our experience mid-term breaks and reading weeks 
      do <em>not</em> work well:
      bootcamps held then usually have high no-show rates.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Bootcamps can also be scheduled immediately before or after a conference
      (or run as a tutorial within a conference).
      In this case,
      the conference organizers must be involved early and often.
    </p>
  </div> <!-- host_when -->
  
    <div id="host_followup">
      <h4>Should there be follow-up sessions?</h4>
  
      <p>
        The host will decide <em>before</em> the bootcamp
        what kind of follow-up they're going to offer (if any).
        Some groups run weekly lunch-and-learn sessions 
        for a couple of months after a bootcamp
        to help people put what they've learned into action.
        Other groups set up mailing lists,
        and we've tried running online tutorials.
        Whatever they decide to do,
        figuring it out in advance means that they can 
        tell learners about it at least a couple of times.
      </p>
    </div> <!-- host_followup -->

    <h3>Initial Organization</h3>

  <div id="host_instructors">
  <h4>Instructors</h4>
  
    <p>
      A bootcamp room of approximately 40 people needs at least two
      instructors, and a third is a good idea, because:
    </p>
  
    <ul>
      <li>
	It's too much to ask a single person to talk for eight hours a day for two days.
      </li>
      <li>
	Attendees will be more engaged if they hear from more than one person.
      </li>
      <li>
	Having two or three instructors reduces the risk of having to cancel
	because of illness,
	travel mishaps,
	etc.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Instructors must be recruited <em>before</em> advertising the bootcamp or opening up registration.
      At least one instructor must be certified by Software Carpentry
      in order for the bootcamp to use our name and logo.
      The other instructors should have prior teaching experience,
      be taking the <a href="{{page.root}}/faq.html#how-become-instructor">instructor training</a>,
      or have helped with at least one previous bootcamp.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="admin_list">
    <h4>Mailing list</h4>
  
    <p>
    Once the bootcamp has a full roster of instructors, 
    admin will set up a mailing list for the organizer, instructors, 
    and helpers
    so they can discuss audience, content, schedule, dinner plans, etc.
    (This is optional&mdash;some bootcamp teams prefer to 
    email back and forth without a mailing list.)
    </p>
  </div> <!-- admin_list -->

  <div id="host_registration">
    <h4>Registration</h4>

    <p>
      Software Carpentry admin can set up an Eventbrite registration page
      on our Eventbrite account,
      but some sites do use their own system:
      for example,
      bootcamps being run in conjunction with conferences
      may use the conference registration system.
    </p>
    <p>
    If admin sets up an Eventbrite page, we can give the host 
    adminstrator permission so they can send messages to registrants,
    download the registrant list, manage the waiting list, etc.
    </p>
    
    <div class="well" id="eventbrite">
      <h4>Setting up Eventbrite</h4>
    <p>
      If the host would like Software Carpentry to run registration through
      Eventbrite, we'll need the following information:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>how many people will be registering</li>
          <li>how much <a href="#host_charge">the registration fee</a> will be,
          if anything</li>
          <li>whether the registration page should be public or private</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Eventbrite events can be public, which means they appear on Google
        and in listings, or private, which means they can only be seen by
        people who have the link. We can also add a password to protect
        the registration page further.
      </p>
    </div> <!-- eventbrite -->

  </div> <!-- host_registration -->

  <div id="book_room">
    <h4>The bootcamp venue</h4>

    <p>
    It's the host's job to identify and 
    book a suitable room (or rooms) 
    for the bootcamp. 
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="well" id="host_venue">
    <h4>Characteristics of a good bootcamp venue</h4>
  
    <p>
      You'll need a room with:
    </p>
  
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Front-facing tables</strong>
        so that attendees can watch an instructor and use their laptop at the same time.
        (Typing on a laptop for two days in theater-style seating can cause back strain.)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>High-speed WiFi or network access</strong>
        that can withstand everyone using it at the same time.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Power outlets</strong>
        for all the computers.
        This often involves extension cords;
        make sure they're taped down.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Space for mingling</strong>
        without squeezing between chairs and tripping over cables.
        This is <em>essential</em>:
        if helpers cannot reach learners who are having problems quickly and easily,
        those learners will fall further and further behind as the day goes on.
        Again,
        theater-style lecture rooms are not recommended
        as their banked floors and fixed seating makes it very difficult for helpers to mingle.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>A microphone</strong>
        if the room is large or has poor acoustics,
        or if the bootcamp will be recorded.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Disabled access.</strong>
        (Make sure the washrooms are accessible as well.)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Air-conditioning,</strong>
        because all those computers (and attendees) will generate a lot of heat.
      </li>
      <li>
	<strong>Space to serve coffee and snacks</strong>,
	because learning is hungry work.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div> <!-- host_venue -->

  <div id="admin_webpage">
    <h4>Bootcamp webpage</h4>
  
    <p>
      The lead instructor and other instructors
      are responsible for creating the bootcamp's home page on GitHub.
      (The <a href="https://github.com/swcarpentry/bc">README on the
      template page</a>
      explains how to do this.)
      The webpage should have 
      instructions for attendees,
      including the bootcamp dates, the location, 
      a link to the registration page, and so on.
      The host should make sure this page also includes
      local travel information,
      parking instructions,
      and whatever other information is needed.
      After the bootcamp topic list and schedule are finalized,
      they will be posted to the webpage too.
      </p>
      <p>
      Software Carpentry admin will check that the bootcamp is 
      showing up properly on
      the <a href="{{page.root}}/bootcamps/index.html#future">list of 
      upcoming bootcamps</a>.
    </p>
  </div> <!-- admin_website -->

  <div id="publicity">
    <h4>Publicity</h4>
    <p>
      Once the webpage is set up,
      the host will start spreading the word about the bootcamp
      using our <a href="{{page.root}}/bootcamps/sample_ad.html">example
        text</a> or something more creative. 
      The host can
      tweet and blog about the event, 
      and send emails to departmental mailing lists,
      discipline-specific mailing lists,
      specific people (e.g., lab directors or principal investigators),
      and anyone else who may be interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      Software Carpentry admin is happy 
      to promote the host's blog articles and tweets.
      We'll tweet and blog about the event, too.
    </p>
  </div> <!-- publicity -->

  <div id="host_catering">
    <h4>Catering</h4>
    <p>
    If it's in the bootcamp budget, 
    the host will provide coffee and snacks.
      Doing so cuts the time per coffee break to 10-15 minutes 
      from 20-25 minutes.
      If this isn't possible,
      the host should identify somewhere nearby where 
      attendees can get refreshments,
      and the schedule should include longer coffee breaks.
    </p>
    <p>
      If snacks will be provided,
      try to allow for allergies and other dietary restrictions.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="admin_assessment">
    <h4>The pre-bootcamp assessment</h4>
    <p>
    A few days before the bootcamp begins, 
    learners will be asked to complete a 
    pre-bootcamp skills assessment, usually as a Google form.
    The responses to the assessment will help the instructors
    tailor the bootcamp material to the group's needs. 
    </p>
  </div> <!-- admin_assessment -->

  <div id="admin_travel">
    <h4>Travel arrangements and reimbursement</h4>
  
    <p>
    If there is someone at the host institution who usually handles travel
    arrangements, admin or the host will connect them
    with instructors as soon as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      The host should also make sure it's clear who's paying for what
      and how people will be reimbursed
      <em>before</em> anyone buys plane tickets.
      The hosting site must reimburse instructors directly&mdash;Software 
      Carpentry cannot route payments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instructors should not be shy about asking admin 
      or the host about how to be reimbursed if they're not sure.
    </p>
  </div> <!-- admin_travel -->

  <h3>Pulling It Together</h3>

  <p>
  Once the initial conversations and setup are done, 
  it's time to move forward with the nitty-gritty details
  of running a bootcamp.
  </p>

  <div id="curriculum">
    <h4>Curriculum and Schedule</h4>

    <p>
    The lead instructor, other instructors and host 
    will decide what content
    will be covered in the bootcamp. 
    The lead instructor will put together 
    a schedule of topics 
    and assign an instructor to
    each topic.
    </p>
  </div> 

  <div id="equipment">
    <h4>Equipment</h4>
    <p>
    In addition to booking a room and catering, 
    the host is responsible for providing an assortment of equipment
    and supplies for the bootcamp.
    </p>

    <div class="well" id="host_equipment">
      <h4>Everything you need</h4>
      <p>The host should check that the following equipment and information is
      available <em>and working</em>:</p>
      <ul class="checklist">
        <li>
          A projector (and a spare if you can find one, or a spare bulb if you
          can't).
        </li>
        <li>
          A Mac VGA adapter if anyone is presenting with a Mac.
        </li>
        <li>
          Extension cords and power bars if necessary.
        </li>
        <li>
        Two different colors of sticky notes for use as flags and for
        feedback. You'll need enough for each learner to have four of each color
        per day.
        The two colors should be very distict and preferably clearly
        recognizable as "good" and "bad"&mdash;red and green work well
        (but be conscious of color vision deficiencies).
        </li>
        <li>
          Guest usernames and passwords for everyone.
        </li>
        <li>
        If possible, a couple of spare computers with the required software 
        already installed, in case someone can't get access to the network,
          forgets their machine, has hardware problems, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
          A handful of USB sticks with installers on them
          just in case there are network problems.

  <div id="host_helpers">
    <h4>Helpers</h4>
  
    <p>
    Helpers keep bootcamps flowing smoothly by assisting learners 
    who are having trouble with exercises.  It's the host's responsibility
    to recruit local helpers.
      There should be at least one helper for every ten attendees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of our helpers are scientists who have either gone through a
      previous bootcamp,
      or learned most of what we teach on our own.
      Hosts usually recruit them from the hosting institution 
      and nearby institutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Usually, bootcamps don't cover helpers' travel or accommodation expenses.
      Taking the whole team out to dinner the day before the bootcamp starts
      is a nice way to thank everyone and give them a chance to get acquainted.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="waiting_list">
    <h4>Waiting list</h4>
    <p>
    If registration fills up, potential learners can add themselves to the
    waiting list (if the bootcamp is using Eventbrite). A week or two before
    the camp, the host or admin should contact the registered learners
    and confirm that they'll be attending. If anyone cancels and opens
    up a spot, admin or the host should offer that spot to someone 
    on the waiting list.
    </p>

    <div class="well" id="waitlist_mgmt">
      <h4>Waiting list management in Eventbrite</h4>
      <p>
      Either the host or Software Carpentry admin 
      can manage the waiting list. 
      There are a couple of tricks to managing Eventbrite
      waiting lists:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>You have to manually release people&mdash;Eventbrite doesn't
        automatically detect that a space has opened up 
        and release a ticket.</li>
        <li>You release tickets by selecting the person's entry on the
        waiting list and clicking "Release Tickets". 
        When you release a ticket to someone their name is moved to 
        the top of the list and they are sent email letting them know 
        they have a day to register. If they don't register within 24 hours,
        the offer times out and the host or admin must 
        manually rerelease that ticket.</li>
        <li>Once the waiting list is activated people cannot register outright,
        even if 
        there are spaces available;
        they must add their name to the waiting list
        and have a ticket released to them.</li>
      </ul>
    </div> <!-- waitlist_mgmt -->

  </div> <!-- waiting_list -->

   <div id="photo_release">
    <h4>Photo release</h4>
    <p>
      If the bootcamp will be photographed, recorded, or broadcast,
      the host will let learners know by posting on the bootcamp's website.
      Institutions may require the host to obtain a signed photo release
      from each person if pictures are being taken; the host is responsible
      for finding out if a release is required, and printing out enough
      copies.
    </p>
  </div> <!-- photo_release -->


  <h3>The Day of the Bootcamp</h3>

  <div id="introductions">

  <h4>Introductions</h4>
  <p>
    The host will introduce the instructors and helpers by name, 
    and talk about why the bootcamp is being held 
    and the desired outcome.  
    They'll also let everyone know where to get coffee,
    whether they can bring drinks and snacks 
    into the bootcamp room,
    and where the bathrooms are.
    The host will also remind learners of the 
    <a href="{{page.root}}/conduct.html">code of conduct</a>.
  </p>
  </div> <!-- introductions -->

  <div id="sign_in">
    <h4>Sign-in sheet and stickies</h4>
    <p>
    Before the bootcamp instruction begins, 
    the host will hand out 
    sign-in sheets and two different-colored sticky notes 
    to each learner.
    The sign-in sheets help us keep track of 
    how many learners we are reaching, 
    and how successful our efforts to reduce no-shows are.
    The sticky notes let the learners communicate 
    with instructors and helpers,
    both during the tutorials and exercises, 
    and when giving feedback afterwards.
    </p>
  </div> <!-- sign_in -->

  <div class="well" id="feedback">
    <h4>Feedback, or "What are the sticky notes for?"</h4>
    <ul>
	<li>
        During demonstrations, learners post a red sticky note
        on their laptop
        to indicate that they have a question or need help.
	</li>
	<li>
        During exercises, learners post a red sticky note
        at the start of the exercise and switch to 
        a green one when they finish, so the instructor can
        clearly see when everyone is ready to continue, 
        and helpers can see who needs support.
	</li>
        <li>
        Just before each break,
        the instructor will ask learners to write down 
        one good point 
        (something they learned or enjoyed)
        on their green sticky
        and one bad one 
        (something that they still don't understand 
        or that is bothering them)
        on their red sticky.
        It only takes a couple of minutes for the instructors
        to sort through these,
        and it tells them whether they're 
        going too fast or too slow,
        what they need to review after the break,
        etc.
        (If possible, someone will mail the sticky notes to 
        Software Carpentry admin
        after the bootcamp
        so we can look for patterns.)
      </li>
      <li>
        At the very end of the bootcamp,
        the host or lead instructor can ask learners to 
        give one good point or one bad one 
        about the entire bootcamp. 
        This can be done on the sticky notes, the Etherpad, or
        through a Google form.
        (This feedback will also be sent to Software Carpentry admin.)
      </li>
    </ul>

  </div> <!-- feedback -->

  <div id="flow">
    <h4>Bootcamp flow</h4>
    <p>
    Once the bootcamp starts in earnest, the day will alternate between
    the instructor describing and demonstrating concepts and tools, 
    and the learners
    completing short exercises. Sometimes the learners will type along 
    as the instructor demonstrates. Learners are encouraged to work
    in pairs and groups, and to mix up their groups over the course of 
    the bootcamp.
    </p>
    <p>
    The instructor will ask lots of questions and encourage the learners
    to ask questions too. No more than ten or fifteen minutes will go by
    without the instructor engaging the learners or asking them to
    complete an exercise.
    </p>
    <p>
    Helpers walk around the room looking out for learners who are
    confused or stuck with an exercise, or who have gotten behind the
    flow of the demonstration.
    </p>
    <p>
    Meanwhile, there is an Etherpad open where all the learners and
    helpers are invited to take notes, post links and examples, and
    ask and answer questions. (This is a great opportunity for learners
    and helpers who aren't so gregarious to participate more
    fully in the bootcamp.)
    </p>

  </div> <!-- flow -->

  <div class="well" id="instructors_practices">
    <h4>Good instruction practices</h4>
    <p>
    The instructors will try to adhere to these good instruction practices:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
      If you are using multiple windows 
      (e.g., a command window and an editor window)
        make sure they are both large enough to be visible by all attendees.
        Remember to pause when switching from one window to the other
        so that learners don't become confused.
        If possible,
        use different background colors for different text windows
        to make it easier for learners to tell them apart
        (but keep in mind red-green and blue-yellow color blindness).
      </li>
      <li>
        As you type at the command line,
        read out what you're typing.
        Remember that most learners can only go half as fast as you,
        because they have to watch you type
        then type it all in again themselves.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use Etherpad to share small data sets, snippets of code, and commands with learners.
      </li>
      <li>
      Encourage learners to take notes 
      in the Etherpad.
        This reduces the effort per learner,
        gives you a chance to see what they think you're saying,
        and provides a record after the bootcamp of what was actually taught.
      </li>
      <li>
        Back up the material with your own anecdotes, experiences and evidence&mdash;it
        makes you more credible,
        helps learners understand how to apply what you're teaching to their own problems,
        and prevents the lectures from becoming too dry.
      </li>
      <li>
        Emphasise that good software development skills contribute to productive, reproducible, reusable research.
      </li>
      <li>
        For every question with a binary answer (yes/no, have done/have not done, works/does not work),
        ask learners to hold up green (yes) or red (no) sticky notes
        to help you gauge their level of understanding.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  
  <div id="post_assessment">
    <h4>Post-bootcamp assessment</h4>
    <p>
    Before the bootcamp ends, the host or an instructor will direct 
    the learners to a post-bootcamp assessment. This is very much like
    the pre-bootcamp assessment, and helps us establish 
    how well our bootcamps
    actually work.
    </p>
    <p>
    Note that we match the pre- and post-bootcamp assessments answers
    using email addresses, so learners should use the same address when
    answering both surveys.
    </p>
    <p>
    We have plans to ultimately send a third assessment a few months
    after the bootcamp, to see how well and how long learners'
    new knowledge and skills stick around.
    </p>
  </div> <!-- post_assessment -->

  <div id="parting_words">
    <h4>Parting words</h4>
    <p>
    At the end of the bootcamp, the host or an instructor 
    will give the learners some
    final pieces of information:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>how to <a href="{{page.root}}/blog/2013/06/after-wise.html">get 
        more help</a> with the topics they have learned about</li>
      <li>how to get involved with Software Carpentry

	<a href="{{page.root}}/pages/discuss.html">joining our discussions</a>,
	or helping us <a href="{{page.root}}/pages/create.html">create material</a>.
      </li>
      <li>how to participate in any follow-up sessions the host is planning</li>
    </ul>
  </div> <!-- parting_words -->

  <h3 id="after">After the Bootcamp</h3>

  <div id="host_report">
    <h4>Report back</h4>
  
    <p>
      Once the bootcamp is over,
      the host will send the following information 
      to Software Carpentry admin:
    </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
        the number of attendees
        </li>
        <li>names and email addresses of attendees, for our internal database
        and so we can invite them to join our announcements mailing list
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      The host will also let admin know how the bootcamp went.
      Was it the right content?
      The right pace?
      Did it seem well organized
      or were there things we could improve?
      What did you hear from learners afterward,
      and would you like us to visit you again?
    </p>
    <p>
    We're also happy to hear from the instructors, helpers,
    and learners with comments
    and suggestions.
    </p>
  </div> <!-- host_report -->

  <div id="blog_post">
    <h4>Blog posts</h4>
    <p>
    Our goal at Software Carpentry 
    is to have at least one blog post 
    from each bootcamp, 
    whether it's written by the host, 
    an instructor, 
    a helper 
    or a learner.
    So if you've been involved in a bootcamp 
    and you'd like to write a blog post,
    or if you have written one on your blog,
    let us know so we can post it or link to it.
