  to help change what scientists do and how they do it.

<h2>EPSRC-Approved Software Training for Centres of Doctoral Training</h2>

<p>
  The <a href="http://www.software.ac.uk">Software Sustainability Institute</a>
  was <a href="http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/H043160/1">founded by the EPSRC</a>
  as a national facility for cultivating world-class research through software.
  Based at the universities of Edinburgh, Manchester, Oxford and Southampton,
  it is an EPSRC-approved supplier of training for the Centres for Doctoral Training (CDT) call.
  Its training packages are based on Software Carpentry,
  and its training packages include instructors who will travel to your organisation and present the course,
  a curriculum tailored to your requirements,
  and administration of the training event,
  from booking rooms to organising refreshments.
</p>

<p>
  The EPSRC has recognised the fundamental importance of software in research,
  and the necessity of good software development practices in producing accurate, reusable, and reproducible research.
  The <a href="http://www.software.ac.uk">SSI</a>'s training courses
  make it easy to meet the EPSRC's software-development requirements
  without investing resources into creating new training,
  and without duplicating existing training materials and courses.
