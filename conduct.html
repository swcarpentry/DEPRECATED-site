<p>
  Software Carpentry bootcamps are community events intended for
  networking and collaboration as well as learning.  We value the
  participation of every member of the scientific community and want
  all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience.
  Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy
  to other attendees throughout the bootcamp.
</p>

<p>
  To make clear what is expected, everyone taking part in Software
  Carpentry events and discussions&mdash;instructors, helpers,
  organizers, and learners&mdash;is required to conform to the
  following Code of Conduct. Organizers will enforce this code
  throughout events, but you may also contact us directly by email
  at <a href="mailto:admin@software-carpentry">admin@software-carpentry</a>.
  All communication will be treated as confidential.
</p>

<p><em><strong>The Short Version</strong></em></p>

<p>
  Software Carpentry is dedicated to providing a harassment-free
  learning experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual
  orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race,
  religion, or choice of text editor. We do not tolerate harassment of
  participants in any form.
</p>

<ol>

  <li>
    All communication should be appropriate for a professional
    audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual
    language and imagery is not appropriate for any event.
  </li>

  <li>
    Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees.
  </li>

  <li>
    Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist,
    racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate.
  </li>

</ol>

<p>
  Attendees violating these rules may be asked to leave the event at
  the sole discretion of the conference organizers without a refund of
  any fee that may have been levied.
</p>

<p>
  Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly event for all.
</p>

<p><em><strong>The Longer Version</strong></em></p>

<p>
  Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender,
  sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size,
  race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate
  intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or
  recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events,
  inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
</p>

<p>
  Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to
  comply immediately.
</p>

<p>
  Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist,
  racist, and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those
  around you.
</p>

<p>
  If a participant engages in behavior that violates this code of
  conduct, the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate,
  including warning the offender or expulsion from the event with no
  refund of any fee that may have been levied.
