We are running a Software Carpentry workshop here at Euphoric
State University on January 1-2, 2014, and would like to invite
you attend.  Software Carpentry's aim is to teach researchers
basic computing concepts and skills so that they can get more done
in less time, and with less pain.  Our curriculum includes

  Day 1 a.m.: Introduction to Unix shell.
  Day 1 p.m.: Version control plus an introduction to databases and SQL.
  Day 2 a.m.: Introduction to programming with Python.
  Day 2 p.m.: More on Python plus testing and reproducible research.

Our instructors are scientists like yourselves: Dr. Nelle Nemo is a
marine biologist who has just returned from a six-month survey
gelatinous marine life in the North Pacific Gyre, and Carla Climate is
a post-doc in meteorology studying climate change in the Northern and
Southern hemispheres.

Software Carpentry's teaching is hands-on, so participants are required to
bring their own laptops.  (We will provide instructions on setting up the
required software several days in advance.)  You will also be asked to complete
a pre-workshop assessment as part of the registration process so that
instruction can be tailored to your needs and skills.

The cost for the workshop is only $40. To register, please go to:

We encourage participants to sign up in pairs or groups, so that 
you have support applying what you've learned after the workshop.

See http://some.other.url for information about this workshop in
particular, or http://software-carpentry.org for information about
Software Carpentry.  If you would like more information, please email
someone@somewhere.com.

We look forward to seeing you there!
Thanks,
