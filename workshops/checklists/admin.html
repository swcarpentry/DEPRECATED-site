<p>
  Admin is the staff at Software Carpentry's (virtual) headquarters
  who support workshop hosts by finding instructors,
  setting up registration
  and assessment,
  and other tasks.

  <h3>Preliminaries</h3>
  <p>
    Before the workshop host has committed to holding a workshop, 
    Software Carpentry admin helps them decide 
    when and where the workshop should be,
    advises on likely cost,
    and provides other guidance.
