title: Workshop Checklist &mdash; Host
---
<p>
  A workshop host is a person (or group of people)
  who would like to arrange a workshop at their university,
  research lab,
  company,
  conference,
  or other venue.
  Hosts are responsible for finding funding for the workshop, 
  booking a room and catering,
  recruiting local helpers,
  and finding supplies like extension cords and sticky notes.
</p>

<div class="well">
  <h4>Getting Started</h4>
  <p>
    If you're considering hosting a workshop,
    think about:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Where it will be:
      Is a
      <a href="{{page.root}}/workshops/operations.html#host_venue">good venue</a> available?
      Will it cost anything to book?
    </li>
    <li>
      When it will be:
      Lots of factors will affect
      <a href="{{page.root}}/workshops/operations.html#host_when">when you can hold your workshop</a>;
      think about what makes sense for you and your audience.
      Be flexible,
      because instructor availability at our end will be a factor too.
    </li>
    <li>
      How you will fund it:
      The <a href="{{page.root}}/workshops/operations.html#host_cost">cost of running a workshop</a>
      includes instructors' travel and lodging,
      the cost of booking the room,
      catering,
      and any donation you would like to make to help keep Software Carpentry going.
    </li>
    <li>
      Who the audience will be:
      Will the workshop be open to
      people in your lab,
      in your department,
      at your university or company,
      attending a conference,
      or anyone nearby?
      <a href="{{page.root}}/workshops/operations.html#host_numbers">How many learners</a>
      can you accommodate?
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    The answers to those questions will determine:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="{{page.root}}/workshops/operations.html#host_who">Who will be permitted to attend</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="{{page.root}}/workshops/operations.html#host_charge">What it will cost</a>
      to attend the workshop (if anything).
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="{{page.root}}/workshops/operations.html#host_followup">What kind of follow-up</a>
      will be offered (if any).
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    After you've thought about all that,
    fill out a <a href="{{page.root}}/workshops/request.html">Workshop Request Form</a>
    or <a href="mailto:{{site.contact}}">email us</a>
    and let us know:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      your location and institution;
    </li>
    <li>
      your potential dates;
    </li>
    <li>
      the likely audience (research field, previous computing experience); and
    </li>
    <li>
      how many learners you're expecting.
    </li>
  </ul>

<div class="well">  
  <h4>Finalize Details</h4>
  <p>
    Together with the Software Carpentry administrator:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Find 
      <a href="{{page.root}}/workshops/operations.html#host_instructors">two or three instructors</a>
      per room.
    </li>
    <li>
      If there is someone at your institution 
      who handles travel arrangements,
      connect instructors with them as soon as possible.
      If not, make sure instructors know how to submit receipts.
    </li>
    <li>
      Set a date.
    </li>
    <li>
      Set up registration (if you are handling it yourself)
      or give Software Carpentry admin the
      <a href="{{page.root}}/workshops/operations.html#eventbrite">information needed</a>
      to set up an Eventbrite registration page.
    </li>
 </ul>
</div>

<div class="well">
  <h4>Local Coordination</h4>

      and the helpers.)
    </li>
    <li>
      If you are restricting registration to a particular audience,
      monitor registration.
      (Software Carpentry admin will give you access to the Eventbrite event.)
    </li>
    <li>
      Book <a href="{{page.root}}/workshops/operations.html#host_catering">catering</a>
      (if you are supplying coffee and snacks)
      or find out where the nearest coffee shop is.
    </li>
    <li>
      Obtain or locate <a href="{{page.root}}/workshops/operations.html#equipment">all necessary gear</a>.

    </li>
    <li>
      Confirm that instructors have booked their travel
      and that they know how to submit receipts for reimbursement.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you are using something other than 
      first-come&ndash;first-served registration,
      select the attendees you want to attend and 
      let them know they have a seat.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="{{page.root}}/workshops/operations.html#publicity">Advertise</a> your workshop.

<div class="well">
  <h4>A Week Before</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Email workshop registrants and tell them:
      <ul>
        <li>
	  to visit the workshop web page for setup information,
          workshop location,
	  etc.
	  Emphasize the importance of setting up their computers well in advance.
	</li>
        <li>
	  to let us know if they can't come to the workshop.
          (They can't cancel their own registration on Eventbrite&mdash;they 
          have to email you or Software Carpentry admin.)
	</li>
        <li>
	  anything else they need to know about the location, parking, etc.
	</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      If there are cancellations,
      offer those spaces to people on the waiting list.
      (Eventbrite doesn't do this automatically.)
    </li>
    <li>
      If possible,
      plan dinner or drinks with the helpers and instructors 
      the evening before the workshop.
      (Planning to go out for drinks or dinner after the first day 
      is not a terrible idea, either.)
    </li>
    <li>
      Find out where the bathrooms are,
      how to work the air conditioning,
      and who to call if something goes wrong with the facility or network.
    </li>
    <li>
      Make sure security will be expecting you and the doors will be unlocked.
    </li>
    <li>
      Print out sign-in sheets.
    </li>
    <li>
      Consider organizing a gathering for dinner or drinks
      for the participants and instructors to mingle.
      This is a great opportunity for people to network
      and for participants to give feedback in a casual setting.
    </li>

</div>

<div class="well">
  <h4>After the Workshop</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Send the names and email addresses of those who actually
      attended&mdash;not just registered&mdash;to
      Software Carpentry admin.
      An easy way to do this is by sending us the sign-in sheets.
