title: Pre-Assessment for Learners
---
<p>
  The Software Carpentry administrators will send a survey like this one
  to people who have registered for a workshop
  a week or two before it starts
  so that instructors know who they are teaching,
  and so that we have a baseline to compare against
  when assessing impact.
  Please do <em>not</em> send the survey yourself:
  we are continually improving it,
  and data collection is much easier if results come back to a central location.
