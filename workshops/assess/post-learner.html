title: Post-Assessment for Learners
---
<p>
  The Software Carpentry administrators will send a survey like this one to learners
  after a workshop
  so that we can assess the impact our training is having.
  Please do <em>not</em> send the survey yourself:
  we are continually improving it,
  and data collection is much easier if results come back to a central location.
