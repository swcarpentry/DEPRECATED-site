    <a href="http://fandemonium.github.io/" class="person">Fan Yang</a>
    is currently a postdoctoral research scientist at Iowa State
    University.  Her research interest is studying microbial
    communities and extrapolating their functions and impacts from integrated
    datasets, such as sequence data and biogeochemistry data. She was greatly benefited by attending a Software Carpentry
    course when she was in graduate school and would like to pass on
    the great experience and learn more through teaching.
