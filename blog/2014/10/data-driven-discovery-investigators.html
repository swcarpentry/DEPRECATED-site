  <a href="http://www.moore.org/programs/science/data-driven-discovery/investigators">announced</a>
  $21 million in grants to fourteen investigators in the emerging field of data-driven discovery.
  Among the recipients are <a href="{{page.root}}/pages/team.html#brown.ct">Titus Brown</a>
  and <a href="{{page.root}}/pages/team.html#white.e">Ethan White</a>,
  who have both been key contributors to Software Carpentry.
  Congratulations to them and to the other award winners&mdash;we look forward to working with them
  in the years to come.
