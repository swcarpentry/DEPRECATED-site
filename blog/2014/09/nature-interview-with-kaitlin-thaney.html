<!-- start excerpt -->
<p>
  <em>Nature</em> has just published a short interview about Software Carpentry
  with Kaitlin Thaney,
  the director of the <a href="{{site.msl_url}}">Mozilla Science Lab</a>,
  and two bootcamp attendees
  (Harvard's Rebecca Perry and USNIDA's Brian Sadacca).
  As always,
  version control seems to have been one of their big take-aways,
  but as Kaitlin says,
  two days isn't enough for people to become proficient:
  our bootcamps really are just the first step.
