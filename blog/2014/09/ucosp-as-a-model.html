<p>
  Software Carpentry's two-day workshops are just one of many ways to teach people practical skills.
  Term-long group projects are another model that I'm very fond of,
  and earlier this year,
  the four people who've been running the <a href="http://ucosp.ca">UCOSP program</a> in Canada
  wrote <a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~rtholmes/papers/icse_2014_holmes.pdf">a paper about what they've learned</a>.
  Some of the lessons rhyme with
  <a href="http://f1000research.com/articles/3-62/v1">what we've learned from Software Carpentry</a>,
  but other insights are new.
  If you know of papers describing lessons learned from other innovative teaching projects,
  pointers in the comments section would be very welcome.
