<p>
  We are pleased to announce that we will be running workshops simultaneously
  at the <a href="{{page.root}}/blog/2013/11/data-science-centers.html">data science centers</a>
  at UC Berkeley, NYU, and the University of Washington
  on March 17-18, 2014.
  These workshops will introduce participants to the skills they should master
  <em>before</em> they tackle anything with "cloud" or "peta" in its name,
  including task automation, version control, modular programming, and structured data management.
  Novice and intermediate learners alike are welcome:
  we will stream attendees into different rooms using a short questionnaire
  to make sure everyone gets as much as possible out of their two days.
  For more information on topics and other details,
  please <a href="mailto:{{site.contact}}">mail us</a>
  or check out the registration pages for the three sites:
