  The incredible expansion of Software Carpentry over the last few months has
  been exciting and a little overwhelming, so we're pleased to introduce the
  newest member of our administration team, Arliss Collins. Arliss's background
  is in engineering and project management, and she'll be working with me and
  Greg on bootcamp management, infrastructure development and maintenance, and
  communications.
