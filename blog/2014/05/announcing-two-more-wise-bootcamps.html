<p>
  Thanks to generous support from
  <a href="http://www.wil.com/">Waterfront International</a>
  and
  <a href="http://www.scm-lp.com/">Stevens Capital Management</a>,
  we are pleased to announce that we are running two bootcamps for women in science and engineering this summer:
  one in <a href="http://swcarpentry.github.io/2014-06-24-wise-penn/">Philadelphia</a> on June 24-25,
  and the other in <a href="http://swcarpentry.github.io/2014-07-08-wise-toronto/">Toronto</a> on July 8-9.
  Both bootcamps are open to female graduate students, post-docs, and faculty in science, engineering, and medicine,
  particularly those interested in analyzing large data,
  and build on previous WiSE bootcamps in <a href="{{page.root}}/blog/2013/06/after-wise.html">Boston in 2013</a>
  and <a href="http://sciencereview.berkeley.edu/wise-athena-swifter-hermes/">Berkeley earlier this year</a>.
</p>
