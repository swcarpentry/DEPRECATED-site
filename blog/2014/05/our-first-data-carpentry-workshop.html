<p>
  On May 8 and 9, 2014, 4 instructors, 4 assistants, and 27 learners filed into
  the largest meeting space at the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center
  (NESCent) for the inaugural Data Carpentry bootcamp. Data Carpentry is modeled
  on Software Carpentry, but focuses on tools and practices for more
  productively managing and manipulating data. The inaugural group of learners
  for this bootcamp was very diverse. They included graduate students, postdocs,
  faculty and staff, from three of the largest local research universities (Duke
  University, University of North Carolina, and North Caroline State
  University). Over 55% of the attendees were women and research areas ranged
  from evolutionary biology and ecology to microbial ecology, fungal
  phylogenomics, marine biology, and environmental engineering. One participant
  was even a library scientist from Duke Library.

  Acquiring data has become easier and less costly, including in many fields of
  biology. Hence, we expected that many researchers would be interested in Data
  Carpentry to help manage and analyze their increasing amounts of data. To get
  a better idea of the breadth of perspectives that learners brought to the
  course, we started by asking learners why they were attending. The responses
  reflected a broad spectrum of the daily data wrangling challenges researchers
  face:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>I'm tired of feeling out of my depth on computation and want to increase my confidence.</li>
  <li>I usually manage data in Excel and it's terrible and I want to do it better</li>
  <li>I'm organizing GIS data and it's becoming a nightmare</li>
  <li>This workshop sounds like a good way to dive in head first</li>
  <li>My advisor insists that we store 50,000 barcodes in a spreadsheet, and something must be done about that.</li>
  <li>I want to teach a reproducible research class.</li>
  <li>I'm having a hard time analyzing microarray, SNP or multivariate data with Excel and Access.”</li>
  <li>I want to use public data.</li>
  <li>I work with faculty at undergrad institutions and want to teach data practices, but I need to learn it myself first.</li>
  <li>I'm interested in going in to industry and companies are asking for data analysis experience.</li>
  <li>I'm trying to reboot my lab's workflow to manage data and analysis in a more sustainable way.</li>
  <li>I'm re-entering data over and over again by hand and know there’s a better way.</li>
  <li>I have overwhelming amounts of NGS data.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  The instructors discussed many of these kinds of scenarios during the months
  of planning that preceded the event. Therefore we were hopeful that the
  curriculum elements we chose from the many potentially useful subjects would
  qaddress what many of the learners were hoping to get out of the course. Here
  is what we finally decided to teach, and the lessons we learned from that as
  well as from the feedback we received from the learners.
</p>
<p>
  We taught four different sections:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Wrangling data in the shell (bash):
    Differences between Excel documents and plain text;
    getting plain text out of Excel;
    navigating the bash shell;
    exploring, finding and subsetting data using cat, head, tail, cut, grep,
    find, sort, uniq
    (Karen Cranston)
  </li>
  <li>
    Managing and analyzing data in R: navigating R studio;
    importing tabular data into dataframes;
    subsetting dataframes;
    basic statistics and plotting
    (Tracy Teal)
  </li>
  <li>
    Managing, combining and subsetting data in SQL: database structure;
    importing csv files into SQLite;
    querying the database;
    creating views;
    building complex queries
    (Ethan White)
  </li>
  <li>
    Creating repeatable workflows using shell scripts: putting shell commands in
    a script;
    looping over blocks of commands;
    chaining together data synthesis in SQL with data analysis in R
    (Hilmar Lapp)
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  This was the first-ever bootcamp of this kind,
  so after it was all done, we had a lot of ideas for future improvements:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
     The SQL section should come before the R section! It makes more sense in
     terms of workflow (extract subset of data; export to csv for analyses) but
     is also an easier entry for learners (easier syntax, can see data in
     Firefox plugin). The learners seemed to get SQL – there were fewer red
     sticky notes and questions were more about transfer (“how would I structure
     this other query”) than comprehension (“how do I correct bash / R
     syntax”).
  </li>
  <li>Each section should include discussion about how to structure data and files to make one’s life easier.
      Ethan did this for the SQL section, and it was very effective.
  </li>
  <li>
    Students were already motivated when they came to the bootcamp; they didn't
    need to be convinced that what we were teaching was important. Many people
    are already struggling with data, and are hungry for better tools and
    practices. Our bootcamp filled up in less than 24 hours after opening
    registration, and there was virtually no attrition despite zero tuition
    costs – everyone showed up, and every learner stayed until the end of day 2.
  </li>
  <li>
    What the best tool is for a particular job is still a big question. When
    would I use bash vs R vs SQL? Learners brought this up repeatedly, and we
    didn’t always have good answers that didn’t involve hand waving, perhaps in
    part because the answer depends so much on context and the problem at hand.
  </li>
  <li>
    +1 for using a real (published!) data set that was relevant to at least some
    of the participants; for using this same data set throughout the course; and
    for having an instructor with intimate knowledge of the data (could explain
    some of the quirks of the data). #squirrelcannon
  </li>
  <li>
    For the shell scripting section, an outline and/or concept map would have
    been useful to give learners a good idea upfront of what we were trying to
    accomplish. Without this, some learners (and helpers!) were confused about
    which endpoint we were working towards.
  </li>
  <li>
    People who fall behind need a good way to catch up. Ways to do this include
    providing a printed 'cheat sheet' of commands at the start of the session;
    providing material online (unlike the well polished Software Carpentry
    material, the material for Data Carpentry is still in the early stages of
    online documentation); and having one helper dedicated to entering commands
    in the etherpad.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  There were also various things we wanted to teach but that came under the
  chopping block due to lack of time and other reasons. One of these, and one
  that learners asked about repeatedly, was the subject of "Getting data off the
  web". It will take more thought to pin down what that should actually
  mean as part of Data Carpentry bootcamp aimed at zero-barrier to entry. It
  might mean using APIs to access data from NCBI or GBIF, but it’s far from
  clear whether that would be meeting learners’ needs or not. For most
  general-purpose data repositories, such as Dryad, most of their data are too
  messy to use without extensive cleanup.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, we’d like to thank our sponsors for their support, including NESCent
  for hosting the event and keeping us nourished, and the Data Observation
  Network for Earth (DataONE), without whom this event wouldn’t have taken
  place.
