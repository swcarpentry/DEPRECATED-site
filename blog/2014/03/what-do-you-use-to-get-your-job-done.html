<!-- start excerpt -->
<p>
Some of you may have heart of <a href="http://usesthis.com">usesthis.com</a>.
In this site people are interviewed about the tools they use to get their job
done. The format is very straight forward, participants have to answer these
questions:
</p>
<!-- end excerpt -->

<ul>
        <li> Who are you, and what do you do?
        <li> What hardware do you use?
        <li> And what software?
        <li> What would be your dream setup?
</ul>

<p>
I find the site useful and engaging. I thought it would be useful to have
something similar but more oriented towards scientists and developers. That is
why I decided to write my own <a href="http://github.com/drio/rollswiththis">version</a>.
</p>

<p>
I haven't launched yet as I am waiting to get enough interviews to release one
or two per week.
</p>

<p>
Obviously the Software Carpentry community has lots of individuals whose
interviews would be very relevant for the site. If you would like to take part,
please send me an email with your answers to the questions and a portrait photo
that I can attach to the interview. Go to the usesthis site if you are looking
for inspiration.
</p>

<p>
I am sure you also know a lot of interesting people whose interviews would be
relevant. I'd welcome introductions. Please pass on a link to this blog post or
to the site.

<p>
Thank you, I am looking forward for your feedback!
