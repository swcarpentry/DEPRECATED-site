<p>
  At the beginning of June R&eacute;mi Emonet, Kwasi Kwakwa, and Chelsea Chisholm
  ran a workshop at CERN.
  <a href="{{page.root}}/pages/team.html#emonet.remi">R&eacute;mi</a>
  has just <a href="http://home.heeere.com/teach-swc-cern-201506.html">posted a review</a>.
  It went well,

  and some semi-improvised intermediate material.
