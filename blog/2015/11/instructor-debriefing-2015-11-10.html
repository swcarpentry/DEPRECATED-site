<!-- start excerpt -->
<p>
There were relatively few attendees at the 22nd round of debriefing for instructors on November 10, but we thought we'd include a few quick notes about a specific topic: using Software and Data Carpentry workshops to reach out to potential users of high-performance computing (HPC) resources.

<p>
University of Manitoba hosted a Software Carpentry workshop at the end of October <a href="https://umswc.github.io/2015-10-19-UMich/">in conjunction with Compute Canada</a>. In addition to the normal half-day lessons in Unix shell, Git, and intro to Python, this workshop featured an introduction to using WestGrid/Compute Canada resources on the afternoon of the second day. The instructor for this workshop, Hossein Pourreza, said that this last lesson module was used as a capstone for helping reinforce and integrate material from the previous lessons, and appeared well-received by the students. Given that there are few training opportunities for using the cluster, this appears to be a great way to introduce new potential users to the basic tools they'll need to get started with larger-scale analysis.

<p>
This recent workshop is a great example of catering the lesson materials to meet the needs of a particular audience. There are some resources currently available for outlining essential skills for remote computing. For example, Data Carpentry has a <a href="https://github.com/datacarpentry/cloud-genomics/tree/master/lessons">genomics lesson involving cloud computing under development</a>.
