  have just posted a pre-print on PeerJ titled
  <a href="https://peerj.com/preprints/1448v1/">Ten Simple Rules for Digital Data Storage</a>.
  The paper is a distributed collaborative effort
  spawned from a thread on the Software Carpentry instructors mailing list
  and further carried out on <a href="https://github.com/swcarpentry/site/issues/797">GitHub</a>.
  There are a lot of good ideas in it,
  many of which we should fold back into our lessons,
  and we hope it will spark more collaborations in our community.

<blockquote>
  <p>
    Data is the central currency of science, but the nature of
    scientific data has changed dramatically with the rapid pace of
    technology.  This change has led to the development of a wide
    variety of data formats, dataset sizes, data complexity, data use
    cases, and data sharing practices.  Improvements in high
    throughput DNA sequencing, sustained institutional support for
    large sensor networks, and sky surveys with large-format digital
    cameras have created massive quantities of data. At the same time,
    the combination of increasingly diverse research teams and data
    aggregation in portals (e.g. for biodiversity data, GBIF or
    iDigBio) necessitates increased coordination among data collectors
    and institutions. As a consequence, “data” can now mean anything
    from petabytes of information stored in professionally-maintained
    databases, through spreadsheets on a single computer, to
    hand-written tables in lab notebooks on shelves. All remain
    important, but data curation practices must continue to keep pace
    with the changes brought about by new forms and practices of data
    collection and storage.
