  Earlier this month,
  we <a href="{{page.root}}/blog/2015/09/publishing-our-lessons.html">published our lessons</a>
  by giving them DOIs through <a href="http://zenodo.org">Zenodo</a>.
  As we said in an <a href="{{page.root}}/blog/2015/08/publishing-metadata-and-the-curve.html">earlier post</a>,
  though,
  we've been struggling to figure out
  (a) how to cite them in text
  and (b) how to express their metadata in standard bibliographic formats
  to produce those human-readable citations.

  <a href="{{page.root}}/pages/team.html#ross.noam">Noam Ross</a> has come up with
  <a href="https://twitter.com/noamross/status/648963898079637504">an elegant solution</a>
  to the former problem:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Gabriel Devenyi and Christina Koch (eds) 63 authors including <strong>Noam Ross</strong>:
    "Software Carpentry: The Unix Shell"  Software Carpentry Foundation, Version 5.3, May 2015,
    10.5281/zenodo.27355.
  </p>
</blockquote>

  I like this a lot:
  it includes the canonical form (editors, title, date, DOI)
  and avoids the issues associated with appearing to ascribe collaborations to
  whichever contributor's surname is lexically first.
  What we still don't know,
  though,
  is how to create entries in standard bibliographic formats like BibTeX
  so that they will produce this text when rendered.
  As distributed collaborations mediated by tools like <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a>
  become more common,
  that's a problem we're going to have to solve.
