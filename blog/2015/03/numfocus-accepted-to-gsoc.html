<p>
  A few weeks ago we announced that we would help
  <a href="http://numfocus.org/">NumFOCUS</a>
  apply to Google Summer of Code (GSoC) as a mentoring organization.
  Yesterday the list of mentoring organization was announced
  and NumFOCUS had been selected.

<p>
  I want to thank very much (in alphabetical order)
  to Andy Terrel, Ethan White, Matt Sottile, and W. Trevor King
  for volunteering to be mentors and making this possible.
  We have a list of ideas
  <a href="{{site.github_url}}/gsoc2015/blob/master/ideas-list.md">here</a>
  but students can apply with their own ideas as well&mdash;in this case,
  follow
  <a href="{{site.github_url}}/gsoc2015/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#students">these instructions</a>
  so we can help polish ideas.
  <strong>Applications on <a href="http://numfocus.org/projects/index.html">any project supported by NumFOCUS</a> are welcome.</strong>
</p>

  <strong>Important dates:</strong>
