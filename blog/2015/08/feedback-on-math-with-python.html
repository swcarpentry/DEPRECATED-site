<!-- start excerpt -->
<p>
  Ian Hawke (who put together <a href="{{page.root}}/blog/2015/04/close-enough-redux.html">these notebooks</a> on testing numerical code)
  is now putting together some Jupyter Notebooks
  to <a href="https://github.com/IanHawke/maths-with-python">teach Python to first-year undergraduates in mathematics</a>.
  He would be grateful for feedback, and we'd be grateful if you could give him some:
  we'll learn a lot about what <em>we</em> should teach from seeing what you think <em>he</em> should.

  (Note: if you click on one of the <code>.ipynb</code> files in the list on GitHub,
  the rendered version will be displayed.
  That's pretty cool.)
