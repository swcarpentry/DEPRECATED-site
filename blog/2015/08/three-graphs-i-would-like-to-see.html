<!-- start excerpt -->
<p>
  I spent part of the weekend chatting with a friend in Cambridge
  who used to be science editor at <em>The Independent</em>
  and now edits <a href="http://scientific-computing.com/"><em>Scientific Computing World</em></a>.
  During those conversations,
  I realized that there are three graphs I'd really like to see:
</p>
<!-- end excerpt -->
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Ask the managers of high-performance computing centers what fraction of their budget they spent on hardware, software, and training,
      and what fractions they would <em>like</em> to spend.
      My prediction is:
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="hst.png" alt="Hardware, Software, and Training" class="responsive" />
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Measure how much computing power all of the scientists at a university (not just those with HPC accounts) use during a year.
      My prediction is:
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="flops.png" alt="Computing Power per Year" class="responsive" />
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Classify all the support requests received by HPC center staff according to technical complexity,
      and see how that changes after something like a two-day Software Carpentry workshop.
      My prediction is:
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="support.png" alt="Support Requests" class="responsive" />
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  The first tells us how much political interference
  (i.e., administrators' desire for photo opportunities)
  skews computing priorities.
  The second will show the mis-match between where computing money is spent
  and what most scientists actually do,
  while the third will show that training doesn't just help scientists directly:
  it also improves the ROI of highly-skilled support staff.
</p>
<p>
  So, anyone looking for a PhD research topic?
