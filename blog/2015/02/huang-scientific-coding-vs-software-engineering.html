<p>
  Daisie Huang recently wrote a great article for
  the Software Sustainability Institute's blog titled
  "<a href="http://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2015-02-06-scientific-coding-and-software-engineering-whats-difference">Scientific coding and software engineering: what's the difference?</a>".
  As a professional programmer who has become a scientist,
  rather than a scientist who's learned how to program,
  she has a fresh take on the differences between what those two groups do.
  Comments on

  would be very welcome.
