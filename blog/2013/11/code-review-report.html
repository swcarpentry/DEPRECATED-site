<p>
  Marian Petre and I have written a report on
  the pilot study of scientific code review
  done jointly by PLOS and Mozilla;
  you can read <a href="http://mozillascience.org/code-review-for-science-what-we-learned/">this summary</a>
  on the Mozilla Science Lab blog,
  or grab the <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.2412">full report</a> from arXiv.
  Our thanks to everyone who participated;
  we hope to be able to do a longer and more in-depth pilot early in 2014.
