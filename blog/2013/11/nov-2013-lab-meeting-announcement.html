<p>
  The first Mozilla Science Lab meeting is happening at 11:00 am Eastern time on Thursday, November 14;
  its agenda and connection details are on <a href="https://etherpad.mozilla.org/sciencelab-calls-nov14">this Etherpad</a>,
  and you're all invited.
</p>
<p>
  Our monthly lab meeting will start immediately after the MSL meeting
  (hopefully around noon Eastern time, but it depends how long the MSL meeting runs).
  As always, we'll run our meeting again at 7:00 pm on the same day to accommodate different time zones,
  and our agenda is on <a href="https://etherpad.mozilla.org/swc-labmeeting">this Etherpad</a>.
  We look forward to seeing you then!
