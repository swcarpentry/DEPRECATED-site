<p>This summer <a href="http://numfocus.org/">NumFOCUS</a> and <a href="http://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry</a> are hosting a <a href="http://numfocus.org/numfocus-is-currently-raising-funds-for-the-following/boot-camp-for-women-in-science-engineering/">software skills boot camp for women in science and engineering</a> in Boston. We are <a href="http://numfocus.org/numfocus-is-currently-raising-funds-for-the-following/boot-camp-for-women-in-science-engineering/">seeking sponsorship</a> from companies and others who would like to help raise the $6000 needed to make this happen.  We'd appreciate your support, and would be grateful if you'd help spread the word.</p>
