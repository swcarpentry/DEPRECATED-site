<p>Last week, we put on the largest Software Carpentry boot camp ever at the University of Washington: three rooms, six instructors, ten helpers, and 93 students spent two days together learning about Python, Git, the Unix shell, and a bunch of other useful things.  Many thanks to <a href="http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~billhowe/">Prof. Bill Howe</a> for making it all possible&mdash;we look forward to coming back soon.</p>
