<p>
  Thanks to some hard work by Jory Schossau and others,
  we have developed three standard questionnaires for bootcamp participants:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="{{page.root}}/bootcamps/pre-learner.html">Pre-assessment for Learners</a></li>
  <li><a href="{{page.root}}/bootcamps/post-learner.html">Post-assessment for Learners</a></li>
  <li><a href="{{page.root}}/bootcamps/post-instructor.html">Post-assessment for Instructors</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
  We hope to deploy these questionnaires starting in September,
  so we would be very grateful for feedback.
  Do you understand what we're asking?
  Do the responses provided include the answer you would give?
  As an instructor,
  would you find it useful to know these things about your learners
  before a bootcamp started?
  And what have we missed entirely?
