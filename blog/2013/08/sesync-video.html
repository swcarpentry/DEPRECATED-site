<p>
  The folks at <a href="http://www.sesync.org">SESYNC</a> interviewed
  Titus Brown, Kaitlin Thaney, and Greg Wilson
  while they were in town for a workshop a few weeks ago,
  and the video is now
  <a href="http://www.sesync.org/video-oci-edu">up on their web site</a>.
  It's a nice, short summary of the problem we're trying to solve
  and the approaches we're taking.
