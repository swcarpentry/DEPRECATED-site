<!-- start excerpt -->
<p>
  Matthew Gentzkow and Jesse Shapiro have written an excellent guide
  "<a href="http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/jesse.shapiro/research/CodeAndData.pdf">Code and Data in the Social Sciences</a>".
  It's short (only 38 pages),
  very readable,
  and full of practical advice for scientists of all stripes:
</p>
<!-- end excerpt -->
<ul>
  <li>Automate everything that can be automated.</li>
  <li>Write a single shell script that executes all code from beginning to end.</li>
  <li>Store code and data under version control.</li>
  <li>Run the whole directory before checking it back in.</li>
  <li>Separate directories by function.</li>
  <li>Separate files into inputs and outputs.</li>
  <li>Make directories portable.</li>
  <li>Store cleaned data in tables with unique, non-missing keys.</li>
  <li>Keep data normalized as far into your code pipeline as you can.</li>
  <li>Abstract to eliminate redundancy.</li>
  <li>Abstract to improve clarity.</li>
  <li>Otherwise, don't abstract.</li>
  <li>Don't write documentation you will not maintain.</li>
  <li>Code should be self-documenting.</li>
  <li>Manage tasks with a task management system.</li>
  <li>E-mail is not a task management system.</li>
</ul>
