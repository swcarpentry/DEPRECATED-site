<p>While we're running our survey of <del href="http://softwareresearch.ca/seg/SCS/scientific-computing-survey.html">how scientists use computers</del> [link no longer active], the folks at MATLAB are <a href="http://www.customersat3.com/TakeSurvey.asp?si=c3Y%2BMBjNHcc%3D">asking their users a few questions</a> too.  If you use any MathWorks products, and have a few minutes, they'd be grateful for your help.</p>
