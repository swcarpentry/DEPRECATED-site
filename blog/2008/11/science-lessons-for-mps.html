<p>Via Nature: <a href="http://blogs.nature.com/news/thegreatbeyond/2008/11/compulsory_science_lessons_for.html">politicians from the UK Conservative Party will be <em>required</em> to take science lessons</a>. On the one hand, kind of sad that they didn't learn the basics in grade school.  On the other hand, yay!, and when will Canadian parties require the same?</p>
