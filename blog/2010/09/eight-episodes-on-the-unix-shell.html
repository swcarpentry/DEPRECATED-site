<p>I had planned to leave it out, but <a href="{{page.root}}/blog/2010/08/another-update-on-what-you-want.html">your votes</a> count: the first eight screencasts of our lecture on the Unix shell are now online. Topics covered are:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="{{page.root}}/v4/shell/intro.html">Introduction</a> (4:09)</li>
<li><a href="{{page.root}}/v4/shell/filedir.html">Files and Directories</a> (9:55)</li>
<li><a href="{{page.root}}/v4/shell/makedel.html">Creating and Deleting</a> (6:23)</li>
<li><a href="{{page.root}}/v4/shell/pipefilter.html">Pipes and Filters</a> (9:11)</li>
<li><a href="{{page.root}}/v4/shell/perm.html">Permissions</a> (10:54)</li>
<li><a href="{{page.root}}/v4/shell/find.html">Finding Things</a> (9:22)</li>
<li><a href="{{page.root}}/v4/shell/job.html">Job Control</a> (5:37)</li>
<li><a href="{{page.root}}/v4/shell/var.html">Variables</a> (6:49)</li>
</ol>
<p>I've already got a list of changes to make (thanks to feedback from IsaacG2&mdash;my apologies, but I didn't see your comments until after I'd recorded), but I hope this will be a good start. And for those who are interested, the eight episodes together took 36.5 hours to write, revise, record, and edit, for 62:20 of screen time.  That's better than the 50:1 ratio I was clocking in June, but I need to squeeze it further if I'm going to finish everything on time.</p>
