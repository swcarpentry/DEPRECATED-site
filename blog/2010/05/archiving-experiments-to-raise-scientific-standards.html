<p>An <a href="http://users.emulab.net/trac/archive10/wiki">NSF Workshop on Archiving Experiments to Raise Scientific Standards</a> begins today (May 25, 2010) at the University of Utah &mdash; the <a href="http://users.emulab.net/trac/archive10/wiki/WorkshopSchedule">schedule</a> has links to some of the presentations, and there's a live video feed as well. Topic areas range from networking and compilers to geophysics and the life sciences &mdash; it'll be interesting to see what comes out, and how it interacts with the <a href="http://openprovenance.org/">Open Provenance</a> work.</p>
