title: Need Something to Debug
category: ["Content"]

<p>Following up on the <a href="{{page.root}}/blog/2010/10/dubois-on-maintaining-correctness.html">previous post</a> about the way Paul Dubois organizes good practices as "defense in depth", we would really like to include a lecture on debugging that does more than present a few general rules like "make sure you know what the right output is supposed to be" or "divide and conquer". More specifically, we need an example that contains a handful of qualitatively different bugs that can be found in qualitatively different ways: one by a code analyzer, another using coverage ("Wait, why isn't the 'else' ever being executed?"), a third by unit testing, a fourth by differential comparison of pre-change and post-change output, a fifth using breakpoints and single-stepping, and so on.  If you have such an example, or are willing to help us construct one, please <a href="mailto:{{site.contact}}">let us know</a>.</p>
<p>(And if you have ever wondered why it takes 35-40 hours to create an hour of instructional video, this is part of the reason: coming up with an example that can motivate and illustrate several related points is <em>hard</em>.)</p>
