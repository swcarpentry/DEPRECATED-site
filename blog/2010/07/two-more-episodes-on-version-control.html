title: Two More Episodes on Version Control
category: [lectures, versions/version-4]
---
<p>The third and fourth episodes of our lecture on version control are now online. These explain <a href="{{page.root}}/v4/vc/conflict.html">how to handle conflicts</a> from concurrent edits, and how to <a href="{{page.root}}/v4/vc/rollback.html">roll back changes</a>.  As with the second episode on <a href="{{page.root}}/v4/vc/basic.html">basic workflow</a>, they use a mix of slides, screen recording, and sound effects.</p>
<p>The next episode is supposed to explain how to create a repository, but I'm still trying to figure out what to show people. A repo on the same machine that's being used for development is better than nothing, but that doesn't help people share work with colleagues. On the other hand, creating a repo on a server somewhere requires at least basic knowledge of the shell: even if someone is willing to type in a password for each interaction (so that they don't need to know about public/private keypairs), they'll need to know enough to SSH in to the server and run "svnadmin create reponame". There are web-based control panels for creating and managing repositories, and we could just require them to ask their friendly neighborhood sys admin to set that up, but it's just enough of a stumbling block to, well, be a stumbling block. Suggestions would be welcome...</p>
