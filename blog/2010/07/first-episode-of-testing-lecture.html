title: First Episode of Testing Lecture
category: ["Content"]
---
<p>The <a href="{{page.root}}/v4/test/intro.html">first episode of the lecture on testing</a> is now online. We're going to be showing people how to use <a href="http://code.google.com/p/python-nose/">Nose</a>, so I've tried to motivate the idea of a unit testing framework&mdash;I'd appreciate feedback on whether it works or not.</p>
<p>And yes, I am working on the version control lecture, but I've been stumbling over minor technical glitches, and I'm afraid that if I try recording today, I'll start using uncivilized language. Hopefully I'll get to it tomorrow...</p>
