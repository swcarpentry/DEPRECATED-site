category: [content, versions/version-4]
---
<p>After far too many delays, the next four screencasts on testing are finally available, covering <a href="{{page.root}}/v4/test/unit.html">systematic unit testing with Nose</a>, why you should <a href="{{page.root}}/v4/test/interface.html">test interfaces rather than implementations</a>, why <a href="{{page.root}}/v4/test/float.html">testing floating point is hard</a>, and <a href="{{page.root}}/v4/test/fixture.html">how to create and manage fixtures systematically</a>. I hope you enjoy them&mdash;have a good weekend.</p>
