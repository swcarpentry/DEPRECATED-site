title: Software Carpentry notes are up
category: [lectures, versions/version-2]
---
<p>I put an alpha version of the notes for the Software Carpentry course [1] on-line yesterday.  Now, I'm looking for a way to convert them into a single PDF document, so that reviewers can download them in one shot.  I've found some open source tools that don't do style sheets, and some commercial tools that'll do one page at a time, for money, but nothing so far that strikes me as being any better than "printing" with PDFCreator, one page at a time.  Given that there are 31 pages, this is tedious enough that I'd like to find an alternative...</p>
<p>[1] The course on basic software development skills for scientists and engineers that I'm writing for the Python Software Foundation.</p>
