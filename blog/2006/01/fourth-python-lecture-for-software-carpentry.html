<p>The fourth lecture on Python for the <a href="http://www.software-carpentry.org">Software Carpentry</a> course is now up.  It covers sets, dictionaries, and a little bit of algorithmic complexity.  Comments and criticisms are very welcome.</p>
<p>And if that's too serious for year, check out the web site for the <a href="http://www.waterfall2006.com/">Waterfall 2006</a> conference ;-).</p>
