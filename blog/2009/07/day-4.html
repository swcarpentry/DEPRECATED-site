<p>Today was all about the Unix shell: <a href="http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~reid">Karen Reid</a> covered a <a href="{{page.root}}/v3/shell01.html">wide</a> <a href="{{page.root}}/v3/shell02.html">range</a> of topics, often using live examples.  Some of the students had never used a command-line prompt before, so all of the material was new; others already knew their way around pretty well, but Karen's explanations filled in some gaps and made sense out of what had, for some of them, seemed like arbitrary magic.</p>
<p>Tomorrow morning, <a href="http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~paullu">Paul Lu</a> is going to introduce them to Make. We're going to spend the afternoon working on the students' own problems, which range from automating workflows to visualization with <a href="http://www.vtk.org/">VTK</a> to manipulating geographical data with <a href="http://grass.itc.it/">GRASS</a>. There may also be some ice cream...</p>
