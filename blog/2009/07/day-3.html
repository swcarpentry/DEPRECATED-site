<p>Day 3 of the course&mdash;we did sets and dictionaries in the morning (glossing over the handwaving in the notes about computational complexity, since <a href="http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~fpitt">Francois Pitt</a> is going to cover that properly later), and then <a href="http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~pgries">Paul Gries</a> showed students some basic image processing. Students found the morning exercise challenging, but seemed to be getting lots out of it. The visit to the pub this evening was still quite welcome, though :-). Tomorrow, <a href="http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~reid">Karen Reid</a> is introducing them to the Unix shell; we'll let you know how it goes.</p>
