<p>We took a detour from the notes yesterday morning and built some classes to represent matrices. One reason was to show students how to break a problem down into pieces and solve them one by one; another was to introduce the notions of encapsulation, polymorphism, and inheritance.  Aran Donohue (one of the TAs here in Toronto) thinks that <a href="http://littlecomputerscientist.wordpress.com/2009/07/21/inheritance-is-over-taught-and-taught-too-early/">inheritance is over-taught, and taught too early</a>&mdash;he may be right, but it's also hard to avoid, since so many libraries and frameworks (and tutorials, but that's a circular argument) expect familiarity with it.</p>
<p>We looked at operator overloading and (very briefly) at design patterns in the afternoon, then did a modeling exercise. What classes would you create if you were writing a program to simulate solar systems? What would those classes' responsibilities be, and which classes would collaborate with which others? The most creative solution included Santa Claus; the most complete took collisions and explosions into account.</p>
<p>Day 8 will be <a href="{{page.root}}/v3/qa.html">quality assurance</a> and <a href="{{page.root}}/v3/unit.html">unit testing</a>. By the time we're done, we'll be halfway through...</p>
