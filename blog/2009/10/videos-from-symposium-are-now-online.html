<p>I have put video recordings of the guest talks given at our July 29 symposium on Science 2.0 &mdash; please click the titles of the talks on the <a href="http://www.software-carpentry.org/v3/movies/index.html">index page</a>. Thanks again to all of our speakers, to the MaRS Centre technicians for the raw recordings, and to Tanya Murdoch for editing.</p>
