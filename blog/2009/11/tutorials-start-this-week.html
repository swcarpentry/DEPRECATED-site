<p>After a lot of hard work from <a href="http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~psych/students/vuvan.html">Dominique</a> and <a href="http://skoolr.blogspot.com/">Jon</a>, we're kicking off warmup tutorials for Software Carpentry this week. 65 students from Psychology, Linguistics, Chemical Engineering, and a couple of other departments will get three weeks of review on basic programming, then start the regular material in January. Our thanks to <a href="http://mitacs.ca">MITACS</a>, the <a href="http://www.mathworks.com">MathWorks</a>, <a href="http://www.scinet.utoronto.ca">SciNet</a>, and <a href="http://www.cs.utoronto.ca">DCS</a> for their support.</p>
