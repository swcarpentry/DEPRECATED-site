<p>Our rough guide to what students should know before taking this course is now on the prerequisites page.  If you don't feel confident you know this material, but still want to take the course in July, please let us know: we're organizing some tutorial sessions in May and June.</p>
<p><em>Note: the prerequisites page has been retired. Please see the <a href="{{page.root}}/pages/audience.html">target audience</a> page instead.</em></p>
