<p>My <a href="{{page.root}}/blog/2009/12/dudley-and-butte-on-software-skills.html">last
post</a> linked to
a <a href="http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1000589">PLoS
paper</a> by Dudley and Butte on developing effective bioinformatics
programming skills. I asked, "How many hours do the authors think are
needed to acquire these skills?" In
response, <a href="http://med.stanford.edu/profiles/Atul_Butte">Atul
Butte</a> said, "I think the ideal scenario is when one's research
projects enable one to learn these skills, so that these skills get
learned in a practical way outside the classroom too, while doing
science," while <a href="http://www.mutualinformation.org/">Luis Pedro
Coelho</a> asked, "Does it matter over the long (or even medium) term?
Isn't improving your skills even you if aren't being immediately
productive what school is for?"</p>

<p>To which I can only respond, "Yeah, but that doesn't work." People
have been doing computational science for almost seventy years, and
have been calling it the third branch of science since (at least) the
mid-1980s. If picking things up by osmosis was going to work as an
educational strategy, we'd know by now. Instead, what
we <a href="{{page.root}}/papers/secse-survey-2009.pdf">actually</a>
<a href="{{page.root}}/papers/amsci-survey-2009.pdf">see</a>
hasn't changed in 25 years: a small minority working wonders, and the
vast majority not even knowing where they ought to start. We don't
expect grad students to pick up all the math and stats they need by
osmosis, on their own, without any structured guidance&mdash;why
should expect them to become proficient computationalists that
way?</p>
