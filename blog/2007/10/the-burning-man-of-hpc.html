<p>It's a small world: Andy Oram, my co-editor on <a href="http://beautifulcode.oreillynet.com/"><em>Beautiful Code</em></a>, just <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2007/10/supercomputing-challenge-at-hi.html">interviewed</a> Brent Gorda, co-author of the first version of the <a href="http://swc.scipy.org">Software Carpentr</a>y course, about the <a href="http://sc07.supercomputing.org/?pg=clusterchlng.html">cluster challenge</a> that's running at <a href="http://sc07.supercomputing.org/">Supercomputing'07</a>. Don't be fooled by the purple-on-black titles: this is a very cool idea.  Students teams get fixed time (and fixed electrical power) to put together a cluster and run some benchmarks.  Doing this earned you a PhD twenty years ago; ten years ago, it would have been a line item in a department's budget.  It's now a contest for students, and I look forward to finding a cluster in the bottom of a cereal box before I die... ;-)</p>
<p><em>Later: Brent has started <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/onlamp/blog/2007/11/sc07_cluster_challenge_introdu.html">blogging</a> about the Cluster Challenge at O'Reilly's ONLamp site. I'm looking forward to hearing how the teams do.</em></p>
