<p>Day 1 of the Trieste bootcamp was a success! Katy and I covered the Bash shell and git. It was encouraging to see students in the lab after dinner working on their shell exercises. In general, the students are very enthusiastic. Later we'll try to list their home countries. So far, I've met people from Colombia, Mexico, Argentina, South Africa, Cameroon, Nigeria, Romania, Italy, Pakistan, Iran, India, and China. Their fields range from astronomy to nuclear physics to climate science.</p>
<p>Today, we are starting Python. You can follow our material on our github page's <a href="https://github.com/thehackerwithin/PyTrieste/wiki">wiki</a>. Pay particular attention to Katy's lectures on git and github, where she introduced git for personal use in hour one then introduced collaborative use through github in the second hour.</p>
<p>Here's a picture (more to come!)</p>
