<p>Our hosting service, Dreamhost, is relocating various domains to new servers. As a result, service at this site is suffering from longer-than-usual lag (90 seconds or more to load the home page, worse for pages with embedded videos). We've filed a problem report, and will try to get things back on track as quickly as possible. We will also start looking for a new hosting plan: slow-and-slower has become all too common here :-(</p>
