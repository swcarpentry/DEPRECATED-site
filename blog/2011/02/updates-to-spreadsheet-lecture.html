category: [content, versions/version-4]

<p>We have just posted updates to the first seven episodes of the <a href="{{page.root}}/v4/spreadsheets/">lecture on spreadsheets</a>: the new version uses Excel 2010, and the screencasts are larger to make things easier to see.  Please let us know what you think.</p>
