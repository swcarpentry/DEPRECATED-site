<p>As another followup to the recent post on <a href="{{page.root}}/blog/2011/02/how-to-contribute.html">how to contribute</a>, I'd welcome pointers to places that might host or mirror Software Carpentry material. Efforts like MIT's OpenCourseware and CMU's Open Learning Initiative seem to host only the content they produce themselves; the <a href="http://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a> seems open to contributions, though I don't see any, and then there's <a href="http://academicearth.org/">Academic Earth</a>. Where else could we put our content to get it in front of more people?</p>
