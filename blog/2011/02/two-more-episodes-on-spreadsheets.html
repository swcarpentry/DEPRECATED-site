title: Two More Episodes on Spreadsheets
category: ["Content"]
---
<p>We have added two more short episodes on spreadsheets, covering <a href="{{page.root}}/v4/spreadsheets/pivot.html">pivot tables</a> and <a href="{{page.root}}/v4/spreadsheets/named.html">named cell ranges</a>. Please let us know if you find them useful, and what else we should cover to help researchers who use spreadsheets to work with data.</p>
