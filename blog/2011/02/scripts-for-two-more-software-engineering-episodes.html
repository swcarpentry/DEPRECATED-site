title: Scripts for Two More Software Engineering Episodes
category: [content, versions/version-4]
---
<p>We've posted the scripts for two more episodes on software engineering (but not the slides or videos, since they don't exist yet). I'm not happy with the discussion of agile: it feels like too much has been left out, but I'm not sure what to add without breaking our self-imposed 10-minute limit.  I also don't know how much our audience <em>needs</em> to know: these episodes are meant to be end-of-course pointers to other material they could look at next, so we're after a big-picture guide to "should I dig deeper" rather than the details. As always, feedback is welcome...</p>
