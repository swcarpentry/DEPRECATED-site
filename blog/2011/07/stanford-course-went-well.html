<p><a href="http://risa.stanford.edu/">Prof. Risa Wechsler</a>, along with Alex Ji and Zahan Malkani, recently ran a short course at Stanford based in part on Software Carpentry called Physics 91S1: Practical Computing for Scientists. <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/class/physics91SI/cgi-bin/?page_id=23">The course notes</a> and <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/class/physics91SI/cgi-bin/?page_id=13">handouts</a> are available online, and the open source bits of code are on <a href="https://github.com/zahanm/teachingtools">GitHub</a>. We hope you find them useful...</p>
