<p>I've converted three more Software Carpentry lectures to chapter format, bringing the total to four:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="{{page.root}}/book/shell.html">the shell</a></li>
<li><a href="{{page.root}}/book/numpy.html">number crunching with NumPy</a></li>
<li>regular expressions</li>
<li>software engineering</li>
</ol>
<p>It's all CC-A licensed, and yeah, the images could be a lot better: they're just screen captures from the original PowerPoint slides, because re-doing them as SVG felt even more like <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yak_shaving">yak shaving</a> than converting the text. Please let me know if this is useful.</p>
