<p>I've been working on a graph showing</p>
<ul>
<li>the connections between the questions this course tries to address,</li>
<li>our answers to them,</li>
<li>the knowledge and skills needed to understand and apply those answers, and</li>
<li>the big concepts behind that knowledge and those skills.</li>
</ul>
<p>The latest version is linked from the thumbnail below.  I know it's tangled, but I hope it's the first step toward a roadmap for redesigning this course to serve your needs better.  Feedback and assistance would both be very welcome.</p>
