<p>MIT's OpenCourseWare initiative was (and probably still is) the highest-profile "open and online" initiative in higher education.  According to <a href="http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2010/mitocw-independent-learners.html">this article</a>, they're rethinking their approach to help the self-directed learners who have emerged as their biggest users. I'm really excited by this, and by <a href="http://p2pu.org/">P2PU</a>'s peer-to-peer model, and all the others that are emerging (including the hybrid models we're trying out). I also think that asking "which model will win?" misses the point: each one is a best fit for a different combination of educator, content, and learner.</p>
<p>Now, if only someone would build a presentation tool that <a href="{{page.root}}/blog/2010/11/ratios-and-rework.html">played</a> <a href="http://third-bit.com/blog/archives/4111.html">nicely</a> with these models...</p>
