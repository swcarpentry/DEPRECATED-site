<p>Cameron Neylon recently made <a href="http://cameronneylon.net/blog/what-is-it-with-researchers-and-peer-review-or-why-misquoting-churchill-does-not-an-argument-make/">the case against peer review</a> once again; the dialog near his posting's end is too accurate to be funny.  In this light, calls for peer review of scientific software are probably misplaced; we need a better mechanism than one that's already mostly failing.</p>
